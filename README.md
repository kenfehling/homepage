Personal home page

This site was built using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) and
some other libraries, two of which I authored:

### [react-router-nested-history](https://github.com/kenfehling/react-router-nested-history)
Handles the windows, tabs, browser history, and transition animations


### [react-designable-audio-player](https://github.com/kenfehling/react-designable-audio-player)
Used for the desktop and mobile music players
